quotation: We knew the world would not be the same. Few people laughed, few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds." I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.

I live in San Francisco, with my beautiful wife and two precocious children.

#What is this for?

For the past couple years I've been exploring performance of webtech on mobile devices, and embedding efficient dynamic language interpreters in native runtimes. This is the place where I plan to share the knowledge I've gained, as well as talk about the tech that interests me, ie grandstanding and shameless self promotion.
